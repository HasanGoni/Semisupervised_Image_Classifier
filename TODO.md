#TODO
- Debug the image preprocessing code
- Switch hamming distance to numpy to make it computationally faster
- Consider using numpy instead of PIL, especially when jitter the colour
channels
- Begin writing Keras code for multi-channel shared weights (https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/)
