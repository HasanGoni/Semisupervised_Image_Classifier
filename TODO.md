#TODO
- Settle on models.  Link by Justin Johnson (CS231n) makes me think ResNet-18 is best bet
- Determine if I'll need to implement model from scratch in order to use it on multiple
input channels with shared weights
- Begin writing Keras code for multi-channel shared weights (https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/)
- Profile the hamming distance code (low priority, only will be run at start of training)
- Switch hamming distance to numpy to make it computationally faster
